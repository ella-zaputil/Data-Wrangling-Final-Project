# Behind the Screen: Exploring Movie Data for Deeper Insights
My Data Wrangling course at the University of Iowa tasked me with the project of proposing analysis questions, finding relevant data, and using various techniques to attempt to answer these questions. My project aims to explore the key drivers of movie revenue, providing valuable insights into how various aspects of a film can contribute to its financial success and offering predictions for future industry trends.
